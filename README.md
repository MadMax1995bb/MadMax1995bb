I have several years of experience in finance and risk management and I'm thrilled to say that I started the Le Wagon Bootcamp to change my professional perspective. I'm loving the change in industry and the move from the classic business departments to the technical teams – it's already been a lot of fun and it's really driving my passion forward!
